## App Evaluation Stage
My top 2 app ideas are:
1. All-in-One School Planner
2. IdeaConnect - Idea Journal

### All-in-One School Planner
* **Description:** This app is essentially your all-in-one space to keep track of homework assignments/projects, exams, and quick notes for each of the classes you are  currently taking.
* **Category:** Productivity
* **Mobile:** As much as this could just as easily be a website, it makes it more convenient for users to be able to access these features from the convenience of their palm, especially as a college student who could be more likely to be with their phone than their computer, especially if they need to be reminded about an outstanding task while hanging out with friends.
* **Story:** Students are able to stay up-to-date with all their classes, ensuring that nothing is left outstanding. Considering how beneficial this would be to students, the audience of this app is able to see value in essentially having a mobile and digital accountability partner for school work.
* **Market:** This would appeal mostly to students generally but my ideal target audience is fellow college stduents like myself. In some sense, this may only realistically appeal to studious students who do not want to miss deadlines, but it is ultimately for any student regardless of level of education.
* **Habit:** Considering that is essentially a school planner, the user would likely use the app often, so that they would always be on track with all their work. The app would probably be opened many times in one day to either check what tasks need to be done or to add/edit existing tasks.
* **Scope:** The app in some sense should not be too complicated, at the very most the optional features such as adding the ability of the app to push notification reminders about outstanding tasks. The app realistically just works with switching between view controllers using tab bar navigation, so it terms of technically challenging, it should be very possible to complete it by the end of the program.

### IdeaConnect - Idea Journal
* **Description:** Idea journaling app that allows the user to simply keep track of any ideas they come up. Ideas could also be classified under categoriesm such that it makes it easier to identify others with ideas in the same category as your idea. Could also potentially allow you to connect with other people with similar ideas as you.
* **Category:** Social Networking
* **Mobile:** Considering the nature of being able to connect and network with someone not in the same area as you, being able to access it from the convenience of your po
* **Story:** This app aims to connect innovators with each other in order to spark as much innovation, so that limited ability or resources doesn't stifle creativity.
* **Market:** This is for those looking for their next big idea, whether that is a business idea, app idea, etc. More specifically, the audience would likely be those with ideas looking to collaborate with others that have similar ideas, so that it encourages bringing ideas into fruition.
* **Habit:** The user may not use this on a daily basis, as they would only need to use it when they come up with idea, when they are brainstorming, or when they are looking for someone to collaborate with on their already-thought idea.
* **Scope:** It may be a bit technically challenging to implement the social networking aspect of this app, and considering that this is what makes the app different from a regular idea journal

Upon app evaluation, I finalized on building the All-in-One School Planner, especially considering how much more technical a stripped down version of IdeaConnect would be to build
